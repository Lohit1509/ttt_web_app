# TTT_web_app
This is a simple web-based tic tac toe game that can be played by two players. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs entirely in the browser. It includes a 3x3 grid of squares for players to place their markers (either X or O), and tracks the current player's turn.

Features
->Simple and intuitive interface that allows players to easily make their moves by clicking on the game board.
->Prevents players from making invalid moves (such as trying to place their marker in an already occupied square).
->Determines when the game is over, either because one player has won or because the game has ended in a tie.
->Displays a message when the game is over, indicating whether the game has been won or ended in a tie.
->Reset option is present.
