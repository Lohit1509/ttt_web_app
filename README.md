# TTT_web_app
This is a simple web-based tic tac toe game that can be played by two players. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and runs entirely in the browser. It includes a 3x3 grid of squares for players to place their markers (either X or O), and tracks the current player's turn.
